# Problem Statement : Customer Segmentation-

The growing complexities of customer demand have made it mandatory for companies to focus on customer satisfaction. Segmenting customers based on their preferences, age groups, and geographical locations can help organizations create a tailored experience for each user group. Thus enhancing brand loyalty. For example, if an e-commerce business segments its customers by age and preferences, then it can curate product recommendations based on them. This personalization shows customers that their individual needs are a priority for organizations. Thus it keeps them coming back for more purchases. Overall, customer segmentation is a powerful tool that can help businesses gain a competitive edge. So, you are required to come up with various insights to generate more customers and increase the company’s revenue by building an interactive dashboard using Power BI/ Tableau public/ MS Excel/ Google Sheets/Google Data Studio or any other platform.
